            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>Respondents in civil court not granted an attorney by the government if they are unable to hire their own. Therefore, NWDC Resistance estimates 90% of ppl held at NWDC go through removal proceedings without legal representation.</p>
          <p>If someone you know is detained at the NWDC in Tacoma, WA, and would like legal aid, they have three basic options when it comes to removal defense:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Hire a private immigration attorney to represent them;</li>
            <li>Request that a nonprofit legal service provider take on their case at a reduced cost (compared to private representation);</li>
            <li>Request pro se support (in the form of informational materials, not direct legal representation) from a nonprofit legal service organization</li>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Hiring an Attorney</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Legal representation is the single most predictive factor in whether someone will win their case against deportation or not. - Innovation Law Lab/Oregon Ready</li>
            <li>Benefits of hiring private attorney: more personalized, timely service than when soliciting support from a nonprofit</li>
            <li>Drawbacks of hiring private attny: expensive; total cost varies case by case, but generally speaking, a private attorney will charge about $2,000 as an initial retainer fee to take on a detention case in the NWDC, and then monthly payments
              until a sum of $5-15k is paid in full. </li>
            <li>If someone you know does hire an attorney, it is important that they know their rights as a client and the attorney’s responsibilities to them.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>SOAR</li>
            <li>Catholic Charities</li>
            <li>ICS</li>
            <li>Lutheran Community Services</li>
            <li>These Portland-based nonprofits may take on a very limited number of cases for people detained for removal in Tacoma, WA. However, these organizations often focus their resources on supporting people that are <a href="/get-help-other.html">not currently detained or facing removal and are currently residing in Oregon</a>.</li>

          <h3>Pro Se Respondents</h3>
          <p>Pro se respondents are those that represent themselves in immigration court. By definition, pro se respondents do not have legal counsel/representation.</p>
          <p>If someone you know is <strong>detained at the NW Detention Center in Tacoma, WA and is representing themself</strong> in their removal proceedings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The NW Immigrant Rights Project is a non-profit legal service organization that offers comprehensive informational materials to assist pro se respondents who are detained at the NWDC.
              <ul>
                <li>People detained at the NWDC can call NWIRP toll-free at: xxx-xxx-xxxx to schedule a visit with an NWIRP rep/attorney</li>
                <li>Please note, while NWIRP works hard to visit every person in detention, they are not able to represent individuals in court or fill out relief applications/petitions on respondents’ behalf. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>NWIRP also developed these helpful guides for detained immigrants and their families:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Guide to the NW Detention Center in Tacoma / Una Guia al Centro de Detencion en Tacoma</li>
              <li>Guide for Detained Immigrants / Guia para Inmigrantes Detenidos</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>If someone you know is a <strong>pro se respondent detained at a facility other than the NWDC:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Immigration Counseling Service offers reduced-cost legal services on a case-by-case basis, and may be able to help.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>To request a consultation with ICS, download this <a href="http://immigrationcounseling.org/cms/userfiles/file/NEW%20PDX%20Consultation%20Request%20Form%20ENGLISH%206-2018.pdf">consultation request form</a>, fill it out to the best of your
                ability and mail or email it to ICS</li>
              <li>If you would like support from Pueblo Unido in filling out and turning in your consultation request form, contact us at (above contact info).</li>
              <li>Please note: ICS is a non-profit legal service organization based in Portland, OR and can only take on a limited number of detention cases in Oregon, and cannot support detention cases in other states.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If you know a <strong>pro se respondent in detention and a nonprofit legal service provider is unable to support them</strong>, the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Project offers a wide range of <a href="https://firrp.org/resources/prose/">informational materials</a>              about how to defend your own case.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://firrp.org/resources/prose/">How to defend your own case/Como defender su propio caso</a></li>
              <li>“These self-help materials are designed for detainees to use in representing themselves when applying for some common forms of legal relief from removal. Please note they are written for detainees in Arizona and most were last updated in
                2013, with support from the American College of Trial Lawyers Emil Gumpert Award.”</li>
              <li>“These publications are meant to provide useful basic information about immigration law and detention in removal in Arizona and were created in the course of the Florence Project’s work. Under no circumstances do they constitute legal advice.”</li>
