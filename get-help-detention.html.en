        <p>If you are <strong>facing deportation and would like legal aid with
            removal defense</strong>, you can:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Hire a private immigration attorney to represent you;</li>
          <li>Request that a nonprofit legal service provider take on your
            case at a reduced cost (compared to private representation);</li>
          <li>Seek informational materials created for pro se respondents
            (those that represent themselves in immigration court) and guides
            for relatives of detained immigrants. *Please note*: These
            publications are meant to provide useful basic information about
            immigration law and detention center protocols. Under no
            circumstances do they constitute legal advice.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you or someone you know would like support in searching for a

          informational materials for detained immigrants and their relatives,
          contact us at <a href="tel:+1503600324">503-360-0324</a> or
