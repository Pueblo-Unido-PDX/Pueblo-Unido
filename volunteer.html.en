        <p> In 2017, the Oregon Ready coalition found that legal representation is the most predictive factor in whether someone will win their case against deportation or not. Because immigration is civil--not criminal--law, however, the
          government is not
          required to provide legal counsel to those who cannot afford to hire their own. Private legal representation can cost between $8,000-$15,000 for a removal defense case, and there are few low-cost, language-specific legal resources for
          immigrants
          facing deportation in Oregon. As a result, most people facing deportation are forced to represent themselves in immigration court, and are consequently less likely to win their cases against removal.</p>
        <p>Community Navigators play a crucial role in addressing this gap in legal services, preventing family separation, and building more just communities. Certified Navigators perform intake interviews and help people facing deportation
          submit
          applications for free legal representation through the Equity Corps program. In this way, Navigators can give people in their communities the best possible chance to win their cases against deportation and achieve the legal right to
          remain in this
          country with their families.</p>
